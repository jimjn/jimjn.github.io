My general interest is to combine knowledge from a range of fields from embedded systems to signal processing to develop hardware and software solutions to measure, understand, control and optimize processes. My research at UC Davis is focusing on winemaking as a specific application area.  In winemaking, the ability to measure fermentation parameters enables better understanding of how processing inputs affects the product outcome.  Additionally, real-time measurements enables the prediction of fermentation trajectory and the prediction of fermentation loads.
