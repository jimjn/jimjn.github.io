            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                As a product of ethanol fermentation, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released from fermentator into the environment.
                The OSHA permissible exposure limit is 5000 ppm for 8 hours of exposure, approximately 10 times
                the CO2 content of the atmosphere.  For every liter of juice fermentated, approximately
                64 liters of pure CO2 is produced.  The CO2 in the evnronment of the winery can be controlled in
                the following ways:

                  <ol>
                    <li>Vent CO2 to outside the building</li>
                    The CO2 can be prevented from entering the indoor environment in the first place
                    and can be collected as it is produced and vented outside the building.  While
                    this method will prevent CO2 building inside the building, a better method would be
                    to...
                    <li>Caputure and sequester the CO2</li>
                    The CO2 produced from wine fermentation is ideal for sequestration as it is a) produced
                    in an enclosed space and thus easy to capture and b) highly pure.
                    <li>Bring in outside air to dilute inside air to safe levels</li>
                    This is the least ideal solution.  Wine fermentation is performed in the
                    hottest months of the year, thus the air being brought inside is warm, and
                    more energy is required to cool the building
                  </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Wireless Sensor Network</h2>
            <p>
              No matter what methods are taken to mitigate CO2, there is still
              a need to measure CO2 in the envinronment.  Since CO2 is denser than air,
              a vertial separation will exist, in addition to the inherent varirability
              in CO2 emission and distrubution across a floorplan.  Existing CO2 monitoring devices for
              wineries typically consist of a single sensor mounted on the
              wall, providing only a point measurement, however, the spatial
              dependency of CO2 lends itself to a multi-sensor system.  Multiple versions of wireless sensor
              networks have been developed.  A small snapshot of data is shown below (metric names removed).
              The data demonstrates the variability across a floorplan, with some locations above the 5000 ppm limit
              and some locations near the outside CO2 level of 420 ppm.
